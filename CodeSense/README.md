#CodeSense - Automated Code Review System
📌 Overview
CodeSense is an AI-powered automated code review system that analyzes Python code for quality, security, and style issues. It uses Pylint, Bandit, and Flake8 to detect problems and AI (GPT-4) to suggest improvements.

📜 Features
✅ Upload Python files for analysis. ✅ Check for syntax errors, PEP8 violations, security risks. ✅ AI-powered code improvement suggestions. ✅ Generate detailed reports (view/download as PDF). ✅ Real-time feedback & CI/CD integration.

📜 API Endpoints
1️⃣ Upload File
Endpoint: /upload
•	Method: POST
•	Description: Uploads a Python file for review.
2️⃣ Analyze Code
Endpoint: /analyze/<filename>
•	Method: GET
•	Description: Runs Pylint, Bandit, and Flake8 on the uploaded file.
3️⃣ Get AI Suggestions
Endpoint: /suggest/<error_message>
•	Method: GET
•	Description: Uses GPT-4 to suggest improvements for code errors.

🛡️ Security Considerations
•	Sanitize file uploads to prevent malicious scripts.
•	Limit API requests to prevent abuse.
•	Use environment variables for sensitive data.
•	Integrate OAuth/GitHub Authentication for access control.
